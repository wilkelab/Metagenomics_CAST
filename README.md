This repository contains analysis scripts and processed data for the project. It is structured as follows:

- `data/`: raw data (excludes large datafiles assembled during metagenomic analysis)
- `src/`: scripts for data processing
- `output/`: outputs such as pre-processed data that are ready for analysis, as well as final analyses used in figures
